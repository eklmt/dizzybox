#+title: Dizzybox

A container manager inspired by distrobox.
Disclaimer: I am bad at C.

** Why
Why not.

** Install
Compile dizzybox.c with a C compiler.
Optionally, you can symlink the subcommands.

#+begin_src sh
gcc dizzybox.c -o ~/.local/bin/dizzybox
ln -s dizzybox ~/.local/bin/dizzybox-enter
ln -s dizzybox ~/.local/bin/dizzybox-create
#+end_src

** Progress
Enter works (and can be used on distrobox containers), create mostly works but is experimental.

** Differences from distrobox
Distrobox is a much more tested and stable utility.

Dizzybox does not install anything in the container by default.
Sudo is not included by default; simply use the --su flag for root in the container.

Dizzybox has fewer host dependencies, only requiring podman to use, and a C compiler to build.

Distrobox's main command is a wrapper for subcommands' scripts;
dizzybox uses a monolithic main program which can be symlinked.
